# The ET Programming Language

_ET_ is an open source self-host,bootstrapping **system programming language** that easy to build , reliable, and efficient, performance software.

The compiler will be release in next few months.


# Objectives and Features:

- Easy
- Compiler
- Ability to create output file
- System programming
- Intermediate level
- Web Programming
- Network,API programming
- Performance and high speed
- Supports inline assembly code
- No require specific librarys and tools on user system In normal mode
- No require external runtime librarys In normal mode
- No require external compilers for compile steps

# GUI Development (Web,Software)

This architecture is only designed for website and software (native).

In the future, it will also be available for mobile apps (native).

Mobile structures are not yet complete And need more thought and attention.

```css
title "Name - Main";
description "Desc";
/*
Keyword tag not used on the software, it use on the web.
*/
keyword "key,...,...,...";
style {
  * {
    margin 0;
    padding 0;
  }
  header {
    width "100%";
    height "auto";
  }
  list {
    color "red";
  }
  list item {
    display "inline";
    padding "10px";
    background "yellow";
  }
}
header {
  list {
    item {
      _ "Home";
    }
    item {
      _ "About";
    }
    item {
      _ "Contact Us";
    }
  }
}
```
