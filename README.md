# The ET Programming Language

_ET_ (ET: Earth Tongue) is an open source, self-hosted, bootstrapping **system programming language**. It is easy to build, reliable, and efficient performance software.

The compiler will be released in next few months.


# Objectives and Features:

- Easy
- Compiler
- Ability to create output file
- System programming
- Intermediate level
- Web Programming
- Network, API programming
- Performance and high speed
- Supports inline assembly code
- No require specific libraries and tools on user system in normal mode
- No require external runtime libraries in normal mode
- No require external compilers for compile steps

# Cli Development

```
main:
	_ "Hello,"
	io.write(' ')
	io.write("World")
	__ '!'	
```

# GUI Development (Web, Software)

This architecture is only designed for website and software (native). In the 
future, it will also be available for mobile apps (native).

Mobile structures are not yet complete and need more thought and attention.

An example of the language at work:

```css
title "Name - Main";
description "Descriptions";
/*
Keyword tag not used in the software, only on the web.
*/
keyword "keywords";
style {
  * {
    margin 0;
    padding 0;
  }
  header {
    width "100%";
    height "auto";
  }
  list {
    color "red";
  }
  list item {
    display "inline";
    padding "10px";
    background "yellow";
  }
}
header {
  list {
    item {
      _ "Home";
    }
    item {
      _ "About";
    }
    item {
      _ "Contact Us";
    }
  }
}
```

The end result:
